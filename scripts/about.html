<h2>Project Description</h2>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn this project, we will be working with data and statistics from <a href="(http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> - one of the largest game platform and community in United States. Steam provides developers with sets of useful APIs to retrieve their userâ€™s information. This project will collect data mainly from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/dev">Steam Official API website</a> and <a href="https://steamspy.com/api.php">SteamSpy</a>. The data for the steam official API are collected by the Steam officials. The SteamSpy data is collected by developers that have used crawling software or other access methods to get data from the Steam website. These two APIs contain information about gamers' behavior and general game information respectively. As statistics are provided by those APIs, the primary job for this project is to analyze them and deliver useful information to people in a user friendly way.

Not only will this website provide useful information to gamers, it will also provide a concrete analysis about the gaming industry for people who want to research on this area. Although serving multiple purposes at the same time, this project is designed to mainly focus on delivering information to gamers and people who seek a complete index for games.


With the use of this website, audiences are expected to have a much better idea on the gaming industry. Viewers will get an idea of game statistics in a really visually-appealing way. A lot of importance has been given to wrangling the data to generate useful insights about the games present in Steam.


<h2>Information Displayed (Technical Aspects)</h2>

<h3>Main Panel</h3>
The main panel displays a visual representation of how many players are playing each game in steam in real-time. The geometric attributes of the visuals can be changed using the slider provided. The user can choose the number of sides to the plygon using the slider. Also, a list of top games being played in real-time is shown.

<h3>Online History</h3>
The online history tab shows the number of steam players online <b>right now /b>. The graph also updates in real-time. To display this chart, special web-scraping from the steam statistics website was required. 

<h3>Game Detail</h3>
The game detail tab shows really detailed information about a specific game as
specified by the user. To create the visually-appealing effect, html and Javascript were used in conjunction with the shiny framework. This too utilised web-scraping as an indirect method to collect useful info. Another aspect of this tab is that the dynamic nature of it, meaning the data actually changes with time.

<h3>Random Game Generator</h3>
The random game generator tab displays a random list of steam games. Its purpose is to inspire a person to search for new games and give them a random set of games when they feel bored.

<h3>Game Data Visuals</h3>
The visuals tab displays two visual representations (charts) showing information mainly focusing on game users. The first chart displays an animated scatterplot showing how userscore (rating) and its price are related. The price slider is included to show games in a price bracket and display their userscore. The second visual is a 3D scatterplot which inter-relates userscore(rating for the game), no. of players for the game, and avg. no. of hours the game was played since 2009. 

<h4>Search Function</h4>
This tab mainly focuses on dispaying certain statistics for a specific game. The user can use the input widget to search/select from a huge list of steam games. A concise summary of game information is provided. Also, the user can search by game name and developer name. Thus, it is useful when a person wants to know the games created by a specific developer or just general information about a specific game.
