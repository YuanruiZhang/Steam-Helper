## Project Description

In this project, we will be working with data and statistics from [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) - one of the largest game platform and community in United States. Steam provides developers with sets of useful APIs to retrieve their userâ€™s information. This project will collect data mainly from [Steam Official API website](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) and [SteamSpy](https://steamspy.com/api.php). The data for the steam official API are collected by the Steam officials. The SteamSpy data is collected by developers that have used crawling software or other access methods to get data from the Steam website. These two APIs contain information about gamers' behavior and general game information respectively. As statistics are provided by those APIs, the primary job for this project is to analyze them and deliver useful information to people in a user friendly way.
Not only will this website provide useful information to gamers, it will also provide a concrete analysis about the gaming industry for people who want to research on this area. Although serving multiple purposes at the same time, this project is designed to mainly focus on delivering information to gamers and people who seek a complete index for games.
With the use of this website, audiences are expected to have a much better idea on the gaming industry. Viewers will get an idea of game statistics in 
a really visually-appealing way. A lot of importance has been given to wrangling the data to generate useful insights about the games present in Steam.
